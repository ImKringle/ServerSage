# ServerSage - Your Wise Game Server Guardian
Welcome to **ServerSage**, your trusty companion in the realm of game server management! This Discord bot harnesses the power of the [BisectHosting ServerSpawn API](https://games.bisecthosting.com/docs) to help you command your game servers with ease.

## üåü Features
- **Server Management**: Effortlessly control your game servers using intuitive commands.
    - **Power Actions**: Invoke powerful commands to start, stop, restart, or terminate servers with the flick of a wrist.
    - **Server Listing**: Summon a list of all accessible servers, revealing their secrets and status.
    - **Resource Statistics**: Retrieve and display real-time resource usage statistics for your servers, including CPU and RAM utilization.

## üßô Prerequisites
Before embarking on your quest, ensure you have the following:
- **Python 3.12 or later**: Make sure Python is installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Pip**: Pip is usually included with Python installations. You can verify its installation with `pip --version`.
- **A Discord bot token**: Create your bot via the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and invite it to your server.
- **A BisectHosting account**: Ensure you have access to the ServerSpawn API.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Running your own
1. **Clone the Repository**: Bring the ServerSage to your domain:\
   ~ `git clone https://github.com/ImKringle/serversage.git`\
   ~ `cd serversage`
2. **Install dependencies**: Use pip to install required packages:\
   ~ `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Spawn the Sage!**: Start the bot with the following command:\
   ~ `python bot.py`\
   **Note:** On startup, if the `config.yaml` does not exist, the bot will prompt you to create one. You are not required to rename or set up the configuration file prior to running the bot; it will handle this automatically.
